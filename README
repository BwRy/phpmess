-- phpmess --

simple php use after free exploitation.

@chtg57's unserialize() & __wakeup UaF as demo exploit.

jump(); to control RIP
alloc(); to allocate memory in the heap and r/w to it
mem(); to create a memory mapping (allows you to read/write arbitrary addresses)
ptr(); to leak a pointer inside a newly allocated zval (to get a valid pointer to the heap, used for alloc(), mem() etc..)
